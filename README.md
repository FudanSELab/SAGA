SAGA is a large-scale code clone detection tool. The name comes from "Suffix-Array based clone detection with GPU Acceleration". 
SAGA is able to detect Type-1/2/3 clones in 1 billion lines of code within 11 minutes, with comparable precision and recall to other state-of-the-art tools.

SAGA is still under optimization. Please contact Yijian Wu (wuyijian at fudan dot edu dot cn) for a trial use.
