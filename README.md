SAGA is a large-scale code clone detection tool. The name comes from "Suffix-Array based clone detection with GPU Acceleration". 
SAGA is able to detect Type-1/2/3 clones in 100 million lines of code within 11 minutes, with comparable precision and recall to other state-of-the-art tools.

SAGA is still under optimization. 

We are proud to open-source SAGA at https://github.com/FudanSELab/SAGACloneDetector .
